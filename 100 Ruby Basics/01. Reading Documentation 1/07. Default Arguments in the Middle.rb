# Consider the following method and a call to that method:

def my_method(a, b = 2, c = 3, d)
  p [a, b, c, d]
end

my_method(4, 5, 6)
# Use the ruby documentation to determine what this code will print.


# My Answer:
# This will return an error, becaues arguments with defaults must be grouped together.
# WRONG


#Book Answer:
# We are using "default positional arguments" here.
# Solution
# [4, 5, 3, 6]

# Discussion
# Information about arguments can be found at http://ruby-doc.org/ 
# by selecting the doc/syntax/calling_methods.rdoc link from the core API page. 
# If you scroll down to the Default Positional Arguments section and start reading, 
# you will learn that ruby lets you use default arguments in the middle of a number 
# of positional arguments, much as we are doing here. The documentation shows that 
# positional arguments are filled out first, then the default arguments are set with 
# any values supplied, and, finally, default values are applied to anything remaining.

# In this exercise, 4, 5 and 6 are assigned to the positional arguments a, b and d. 
# Note that 5 overrides the default value for b, but c is not set to any of the listed 
# values. c, instead, is assigned its default value, 3. Thus, when the results are printed, 
#  see the results shown in our solution.

# Don't worry too much if you don't understand exactly how this works. This exercise 
# is mostly concerned with where to find this information should you run into a case 
# where it is difficult to determine how the arguments to a method are interpreted. More 
# importantly, try not to do this in your own code; it's hard to understand.
