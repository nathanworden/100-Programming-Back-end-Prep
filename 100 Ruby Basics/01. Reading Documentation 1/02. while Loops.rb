# Solution
# Select the core API link for your version of ruby.

# Select the "control expressions" link.

# Search within the page for "while" until you find the "while loop" discussion.

# The hard part of this exercise is knowing exactly where to go; 
# documentation for what we like to think of as "the ruby language" 
# can be difficult to find until we know where to look. The "control expressions" 
# page is where you will find discussions of most language features that control code flow: 
# conditionals (if, unless, case), basic looping (while, until, for), 
# loop termination (break, next), and several other features of the language.
