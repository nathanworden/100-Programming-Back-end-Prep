# can be used to right justify a String object.


# My Answer:

# Solution
# #rjust
# Discussion
# Start by finding the page that describes the String class; 
# you should be there already if you came here from the previous exercise.
#  Once there, all you need to do is find the appropriate method.

# This won't necessarily be easy. Sometimes, you just need to scan through the 
# method names until you see something that sounds like it might do the trick. 
#   Other times, you will need to use your browser's in-page search capability to 
#   find something. On other occasions, you may be forced to scan through the entire 
#   page, or followup in the class's Parent or Included Modules (both of which we will
#    see later).

# In this case, we found it easiest to do an in-page search for "justify", which failed. 
#   So, we tweaked the search to "justified" which first found the #ljust method, and then 
#   the #rjust method. The #rjust method proved to be what we wanted.
