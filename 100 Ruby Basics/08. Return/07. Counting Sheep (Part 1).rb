# Discussion
# We're using Integer#times within the count_sheep method to count from 0 to 4 (#times starts at 0). Therefore, it's no surprise that the output includes 0 through 4. What may be surprising, however, is the fact that the output includes 5. Where did that 5 come from? If you study #times in the Ruby docs, you'll know that after iterating 5 times, the block returns the initial integer. Which, in this case, is 5.

# We can use this knowledge combined with what we learned from the previous exercises to determine why 5 was printed. When looking at count_sheep we can see that the #times block is the only code in the method. This means it's also the last line in the method. Since #times returns the initial integer, we now know that the return value of count_sheep is 5.



def count_sheep
  5.times do |sheep| 
     puts sheep
  end
end

 puts count_sheep
