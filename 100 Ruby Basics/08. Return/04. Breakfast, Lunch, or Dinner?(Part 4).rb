# My Answer:
# Dinner
# Breakfast



# Solution
# Dinner
# Breakfast
# Discussion
# When you use #puts it's important to know that the printed value and the return value are not the same. #puts outputs the value it's given and returns nil. Therefore, the return value of puts 'Dinner' is nil. However, that's not the return value of meal. The return value of meal is 'Breakfast' because of the explicit return.

# If the return value is 'Breakfast' then why are both "Dinner" and "Breakfast" printed? The answer is simple: there are two #puts which means there will be more than one value printed.
