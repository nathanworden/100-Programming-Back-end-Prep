# This exercise is a little different compared to the last two. We've made Integer#times the last line in count_sheep again, but this time there's a return inside the block. Based on what we know with return, we should be able to determine the return value of count_sheep. Looking at the if condition, we can see that return will be processed once sheep equals 2. This lets us know the method will end there and return the value provided by return.

# In this case, return didn't provide a value. That's why the last output is nil (we used #p when invoking count_sheep so that nil is visible in the output).
