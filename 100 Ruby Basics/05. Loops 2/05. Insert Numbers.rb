# Insert Numbers
# Modify the code below so that the user's input gets added to the numbers array. Stop the loop when the array contains 5 numbers.

# numbers = []

# loop do
#   puts 'Enter any number:'
#   input = gets.chomp.to_i
# end
# puts numbers



numbers = []

loop do
  puts 'Enter any number:'
  input = gets.chomp.to_i
  numbers << input
  break if numbers.size == 5
end
puts numbers



# Approach/Algorithm
# The Array#push method is useful for adding elements to an array.

# Solution
# numbers = []

# loop do
#   puts 'Enter any number:'
#   input = gets.chomp.to_i

#   numbers.push(input)
#   break if numbers.size == 5
# end
# puts numbers
# Discussion
# When dealing with user input, it's likely the input will either be evaluated or added to something. In this case, we're adding an integer to an array. Array#push works well for this because it will take the value of input and add it to the end of the numbers array, which is exactly what we need.

# Now that we are handling the input properly, the next step is to stop the loop. We can accomplish this by taking advantage of the Array#size method. #size returns the number of elements contained in the caller. To stop the loop when numbers contains 5 elements, we can simply add a break with an if numbers.size == 5 condition.
