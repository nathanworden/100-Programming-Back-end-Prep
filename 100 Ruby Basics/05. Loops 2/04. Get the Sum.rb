# Get the Sum
# The code below asks the user "What does 2 + 2 equal?" and uses 
# gets to retrieve the user's answer. Modify the code so "That's correct!" 
# is printed and the loop stops when the user's answer equals 4. 
# Print "Wrong answer. Try again!" if the user's answer doesn't equal 4.

# loop do
#   puts 'What does 2 + 2 equal?'
#   answer = gets.chomp.to_i
# end


loop do
  puts 'What does 2 + 2 equal?'
  answer = gets.chomp.to_i
  if answer == 4
    puts "That's correct!"
    break
  else
    puts "Wrong answer. Try again!"
  end
end


# Solution
# loop do
#   puts 'What does 2 + 2 equal?'
#   answer = gets.chomp.to_i

#   if answer == 4
#     puts "That's correct!"
#     break
#   end

#   puts 'Wrong answer. Try again!'
# end

# Discussion
# To do anything with the user's input, we must first assign it to a variable.
 # This makes it easier to modify the input or check its value later on. 
 # In this case, we'll check the value of answer in the if condition. 
 #  If answer equals 4 then "That's correct!" will be printed and the 
 #  loop will stop when break is processed. If answer equals anything 
 #  other than 4 then the error will be printed and the loop will continue 
 #  iterating.
