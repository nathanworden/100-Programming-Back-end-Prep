# Even Numbers
# We want to iterate through the numbers array and return a new array containing only the even numbers. However, our code isn't producing the expected output. Why not? How can we change it to produce the expected result?

# numbers = [5, 2, 9, 6, 3, 1, 8]

# even_numbers = numbers.map do |n|
#   n if n.even?
# end

# p even_numbers # expected output: [2, 6, 8]



numbers = [5, 2, 9, 6, 3, 1, 8]

even_numbers = numbers.select do |n|
  n if n.even?
end

p even_numbers # expected output: [2, 6, 8]



# Approach/Algorithm
# Array#map is used for transformation. It returns a new array containing the return value of the block for each iteration. The expression n if n.even? returns the integer n when it is even, and returns nil if it is odd. So with map we get an array that looks like this: [nil, 2, nil, 6, nil, nil, 8].

# Think about which Array method might be more appropriate in this case.

# Solution
# numbers = [5, 2, 9, 6, 3, 1, 8]

# even_numbers = numbers.select do |n|
#   n.even?
# end

# p even_numbers #=> [2, 6, 8]
# Discussion
# More appropriate for our use case is Array#select, which is used for selection and returns a new array containing only the elements of the original array for which the return value of the block is truthy.

# Notice that we also changed the code within the block, on line 4. Although the original code on line 4 would produce the same result, it can be simplified to n.even?. Integer#even? returns a boolean (true or false) based on whether the calling Integer is an even number. Because this method invocation is the only line of code within the block, its return value will also be the return value of the block.
