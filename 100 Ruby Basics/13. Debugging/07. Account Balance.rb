# Account Balance
# Time for a check of your financial situation.

# The output of the code below tells you that you have around $70. However, you expected your bank account to have about $238. What did we do wrong?

# Financially, you started the year with a clean slate.

balance = 0

# Here's what you earned and spent during the first three months.

january = {
  income: [ 1200, 75 ],
  expenses: [ 650, 140, 33.2, 100, 26.9, 78 ]
}

february = {
  income: [ 1200 ],
  expenses: [ 650, 140, 320, 46.7, 122.5 ]
}

march = {
  income: [ 1200, 10, 75 ],
  expenses: [ 650, 140, 350, 12, 59.9, 2.5 ]
}

# Let's see how much you've got now...

def calculate_balance(month)
  plus  = month[:income].sum
  minus = month[:expenses].sum

  plus - minus
end

[january, february, march].each do |month|
  balance += calculate_balance(month)
end

puts balance



# Book Answer

# Approach/Algorithm
# We can test the calculate_balance method by adding a few test cases:

# puts calculate_balance({ income: [], expenses: [] }) == 0         #=> true
# puts calculate_balance({ income: [100], expenses: [] }) == 100    #=> true
# puts calculate_balance({ income: [], expenses: [100] }) == -100   #=> true
# puts calculate_balance({ income: [100], expenses: [50] }) == 50   #=> true
# puts calculate_balance({ income: [4, 3], expenses: [2, 1] }) == 4 #=> true
# We can see that this method works as expected.

# To check what might go wrong on lines 31-33, we can temporarily replace the month hashes with simpler data that will make it easier to see what happens:

# january  = { income: [500], expenses: [] }
# february = { income: [100], expenses: [] }
# march    = { income: [200], expenses: [] }
# Now we expect our balance after these three months to be 800, but instead the final balance output is 200, the balance value of March. So it seems like we fail to add up the values.

# Solution
# balance = 0

# january = {
#   income: [ 1200, 75 ],
#   expenses: [ 650, 140, 33.2, 100, 26.9, 78 ]
# }

# february = {
#   income: [ 1200 ],
#   expenses: [ 650, 140, 320, 46.7, 122.5 ]
# }

# march = {
#   income: [ 1200, 10, 75 ],
#   expenses: [ 650, 140, 350, 12, 59.9, 2.5 ]
# }

# def calculate_balance(month)
#   plus  = month[:income].sum
#   minus = month[:expenses].sum

#   plus - minus
# end

# [january, february, march].each do |month|
#   balance += calculate_balance(month)
# end

# puts balance
# Discussion
# On line 32 of the original code, we simply re-assign balance to the return value of invoking calculate_balance with the current month's data. Instead, we want to increment balance by re-assigning it to the current value of balance plus the return value of calculate_balance.

# Recall that balance += calculate_balance(month) is shorthand for balance = balance + calculate_balance(month).
