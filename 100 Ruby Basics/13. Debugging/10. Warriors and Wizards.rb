# Warriors and Wizards
# We started writing an RPG game, but we already run into an error message. Find the problem and fix it.

# # Each player starts with the same basic stats.

# player = { strength: 10, dexterity: 10, charisma: 10, stamina: 10 }

# # Then the player picks a character class and gets an upgrade accordingly.

#   warrior: { strength:  20 },
#   thief:   { dexterity: 20 },
#   scout:   { stamina:   20 },
#   mage:    { charisma:  20 }
# }

# puts 'Please type your class (warrior, thief, scout, mage):'
# input = gets.chomp.downcase

# player.merge(character_classes[input])

# puts 'Your character stats:'
# puts player

character_classes = {
  warrior: { strength:  20 },
  thief:   { dexterity: 20 },
  scout:   { stamina:   20 },
  mage:    { charisma:  20 }

# Approach/Algorithm
# The error message says:

# rpg.rb:17:in `merge': no implicit conversion of nil into Hash (TypeError)
# The error message tells us that one of the two hashes we are trying to merge is actually nil. If you check both hashes, you'll find that it's character_classes[input] that references nil. This is because we are trying to access the value of a key that doesn't exist in the hash. Here, we have to be conscious of what the type of object our hash keys are and what the type of object input is.

# After addressing this error, the initial player stats still don't seem to have updated. Check out the documentation for Hash#merge. The important question here is: Does merge mutate the caller (i.e. player) and do we use it accordingly?

# Solution
# # Each player starts with the same basic stats.

# player = { strength: 10, dexterity: 10, charisma: 10, stamina: 10 }

# # Then she picks a character class and gets an upgrade accordingly.

# character_classes = {
#   warrior: { strength:  20 },
#   thief:   { dexterity: 20 },
#   scout:   { stamina:   20 },
#   mage:    { charisma:  20 }
# }

# puts 'Please type your class (warrior, thief, scout, mage):'
# input = gets.chomp.downcase

# player = player.merge(character_classes[input.to_sym])

# puts 'Your character stats:'
# puts player
# Discussion
# When we get user input, it is always a String. Our character_classes hash, however, uses symbols as keys (recall that { warrior: some_value } is syntactic sugar for { :warrior => some_value }). So we first need to convert the input String into a symbol, by means of String#to_sym.

# Next, Hash#merge returns a new hash, so when the expression player.merge character_classes[input.to_sym] is evaluated, this does not mutate player but instead creates a new hash, which we neither use nor assign to a variable. So, in order to update the player hash, we have to either use its mutating sibling Hash#merge! or re-assign player to the newly created hash as in the shown solution.
