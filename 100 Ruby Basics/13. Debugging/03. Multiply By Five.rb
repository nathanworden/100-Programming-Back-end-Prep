# Multiply By Five
# When the user inputs 10, we expect the program to print The result is 50!, but that's not the output we see. Why not?

# def multiply_by_five(n)
#   n * 5
# end

# puts "Hello! Which number would you like to multiply by 5?"
# number = gets.chomp

# puts "The result is #{multiply_by_five(number)}!"


def multiply_by_five(n)
  n * 5
end

puts "Hello! Which number would you like to multiply by 5?"
number = gets.chomp.to_i

puts "The result is #{multiply_by_five(number)}!"




# Approach/Algorithm
# Remember that all user input will be a String. In order to perform Integer multiplication, we need to first convert the user input from a String to an Integer.

# Solution
# def multiply_by_five(n)
#   n * 5
# end

# puts "Hello! Which number would you like to multiply by 5?"
# number = gets.chomp.to_i

# puts "The result is #{multiply_by_five(number)}!"

# Discussion
# We can fix this problem on line 6 by calling String#to_i on the user input.
