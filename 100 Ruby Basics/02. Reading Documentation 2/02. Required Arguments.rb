# Assume you have this Array:

# a = %w(a b c d e)
# How would you use Array#insert to insert the numbers 5, 6, 
# and 7 between the elements with values 'c' and 'd'?


a = %w(a b c d e)



# My Answer:

a.insert(3, 5, 6, 7)
puts a




# Solution
# a.insert(3, 5, 6, 7)
# Discussion
# The documentation for Array#insert shows that its signature as:

# insert(index, obj...) → ary
# As with the previous exercise, this isn't too helpful until you understand what it is telling you.

# The part to the left of the → shows that insert takes a required index argument, and 0 or more obj arguments. We know that index is required because the name is shown in the signature with no ornamentation; such standalone names in the arguments portion of a signature are required arguments. Similarly, we know that we need 0 or more obj arguments because this time the name is adorned by ..., which should always be interpreted in the documentation as "0 or more occurrences of the item to the left".

# You will also see 0 or more arguments written as *obj or as [obj]*. In fact, both of these are probably more common than the ... adornment.

# Reading the text below the signature, we see that index represents the index of the Array element before which we want to insert new elements. Since we want to insert 5, 6, and 7 before the element that currently contains 'd', and since that element has index 3, we know that the first argument to insert will be 3.

# You have to read between the lines to understand the obj... part; the text does not mention anything using the name obj; instead, it says "insert the given values before ...". Given that obj... is not mentioned, and since nothing in the signature shows the word value, we're left to conclude that each of the values must be one of the 0 or more obj arguments. So, we'll use 5, 6, and 7 as the remaining arguments:

# insert(3, 5, 6, 7)
# Since insert is an instance method of the Array class, we need to apply it to an Array object, namely a:

# a.insert(3, 5, 6, 7)
# Finally, we must ask if we need do anything with the return value. Going back to the signature, we see that the return value is given as ary, not new_ary; this usually means that the return value is the object to which the method was applied; a in this case. Since #insert modifies something, it must have modified a, so it really doesn't matter if we use the return value, or just continue to use a directly; do whichever is most natural for the situation.

# To illustrate this:

# puts a.insert(3, 5, 6, 7).inspect # => ["a", "b", "c", 5, 6, 7, "d", "e"]
# puts a.inspect                    # => ["a", "b", "c", 5, 6, 7, "d", "e"]
# These two statements produce identical results; this shows that both a and the return value have the same values. In fact, they are the same object, though it needs a bit more work to show that:

# b = a.insert(3, 5, 6, 7)
# puts a.object_id            # => 70127114718140
# puts b.object_id            # => 70127114718140
