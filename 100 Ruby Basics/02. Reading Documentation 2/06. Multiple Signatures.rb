# Multiple Signatures
# What do each of these puts statements output?

a = %w(a b c d e)
puts a.fetch(7)
puts a.fetch(7, 'beats me')
puts a.fetch(7) { |index| index**2 }

# My Answer
# puts a.fetch(7)
# error

# puts a.fetch(7, 'beats me')
# 'beats me'

# puts a.fetch(7) { |index| index**2 }
# '49'



#Book Answer
# Solution
# # puts a.fetch(7)
# IndexError: index 7 outside of array bounds: -5...5

# # puts a.fetch(7, 'beats me')
# beats me

# # puts a.fetch(7) { |index| index**2 }
# 49
# Discussion
# The documentation for Array#fetch has the signature:

# fetch(index) → obj
# fetch(index, default) → obj
# fetch(index) { |index| block } → obj
# This shows that #fetch can be called with an index argument, an index and a default argument, or an index argument and a block. Note in particular that having multiple lines in the signature is yet another way in which the ruby documentation indicates that an argument is optional. In this case, both default and the block are optional arguments, but they can't be used together.

# Reading the documentation, we see that #fetch simply returns the element of an Array by its index, but it also does bounds checking (which Array#[] does not); that is, it checks whether the specified element actually exists before fetching it, and raises an error if it does not exist. The second and third forms of #fetch prevent an error from occurring if the indicated element does not exist by providing a default value or a block that returns an appropriate value.

# With this basic overview, we can tell that the first puts should print an error message; the second form returns the value of the default argument if the element doesn't exist; the third form returns the value returned by the block. So, the first puts raises an IndexError, the second prints beats me, while the third prints 49.
