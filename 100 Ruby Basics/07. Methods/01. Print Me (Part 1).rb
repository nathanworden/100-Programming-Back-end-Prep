# Discussion
# In previous exercises we've used #puts both inside and outside methods. When you use #puts inside a method, you're outputting one thing and returning another. #puts outputs whatever it's given and returns nil. In this case, we're printing the value inside the method, which means the method's return value is nil.

# We can verify that #puts returns nil by using irb.

# irb :001 > puts "Hello World!"
# Hello World!
# => nil
# The second line shows what was printed to the screen while the third line shows the return value. Looking at this, we can see that #puts outputs "Hello World!" and returns nil.
