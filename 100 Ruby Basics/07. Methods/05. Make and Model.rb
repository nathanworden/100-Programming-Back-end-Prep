# Make and Model
# Using the following code, write a method called car that takes two arguments and prints a string containing the values of both arguments.

# car('Toyota', 'Corolla')
# Expected output:

# Toyota Corolla


def car(make, model)
  puts "#{make} #{model}"
end

car('Toyota', 'Corolla')


# Discussion
# When writing the car method it's important to keep two things in mind. First, make sure you're allowing for the correct number of parameters. If the method invocation provides two arguments, then the method must be able to accept two arguments and vice versa. Second, when printing the string, you should use #puts from inside the method. In this exercise, the method invocation isn't prepended by #puts, therefore, to print the string you have to print it from within the method.

# Further Exploration
# Remove the #puts call from the car method. Modify your program so it still prints the result.

# How do the return values of car differ with and without the #puts?
