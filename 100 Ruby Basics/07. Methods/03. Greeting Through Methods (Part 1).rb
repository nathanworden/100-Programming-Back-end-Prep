# Greeting Through Methods (Part 1)
# Write two methods, one that returns the string "Hello" and 
# one that returns the string "World". Then print both strings 
# using #puts, combining them into one sentence.

# Expected output:

# Hello World


# My Answer:

def hello
  "Hello"
end


def world
  "World"
end

puts hello + " " +  world



# Book Answer:

# Solution
# def hello
#   'Hello'
# end

# def world
#   'World'
# end

# puts "#{hello} #{world}"
# Discussion
# To do anything with the methods, we first have to define them. We've chosen to define our methods as hello and world. We've written both methods to only do one thing: return a string. This makes it easy for us to print the desired strings simply by calling the methods with #puts. Our solution uses string interpolation to achieve the desired output. Alternatively, we could have used string concatenation. We will see an example of that in the next problem.
