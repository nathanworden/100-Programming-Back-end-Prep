# Unpredictable Weather (Part 1)
# In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample
# Write an if statement that prints "The sun is so bright!" if sun equals 'visible'.


if sun == 'visible'
  puts "The sun is so bright!"
end



# Solution
# if sun == 'visible'
#   puts 'The sun is so bright!'
# end
# Discussion
# We're originally given a variable named sun. We know that its value will either be 'visible' or 'hidden'. Therefore, when writing the condition for our if statement, we can easily determine what the condition should be. One of the simplest ways to write this condition is to use ==, which returns true only if the two compared entities have the same value.

# Knowing this, we can compare sun with 'visible' in our if condition. If this comparison evaluates to true, then we'll use #puts to print "The sun is so bright!".
