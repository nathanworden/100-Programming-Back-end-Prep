if number

else
  puts "I don't have a favorite number."
end


# My answer"
# My favorite number is 7



# Solution
# "My favorite number is 7."
# Discussion
# The key thing to keep in mind when determining what the code will print is that in Ruby, every expression evaluates to true when used in a condition. The only two exceptions to this are false and nil. Therefore, "My favorite number is 7." will print regardless of number's value as long as it's truthy.
