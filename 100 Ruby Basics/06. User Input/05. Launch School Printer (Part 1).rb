# Launch School Printer (Part 1)
# Write a program that prints 'Launch School is the best!' repeatedly until a certain number of lines have been printed. The program should obtain the number of lines from the user, and should insist that at least 3 lines are printed.

# For now, just use #to_i to convert the input value to an Integer, and check that result instead of trying to insist on a valid number; validation of numeric input is a topic with a fair number of edge conditions that are beyond the scope of this exercise.

# Examples:

# $ ruby lsprint.rb
# >> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:
# 5
# Launch School is the best!
# Launch School is the best!
# Launch School is the best!
# Launch School is the best!
# Launch School is the best!

# $ ruby lsprint.rb
# >> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:
# 2
# >> That's not enough lines.
# >> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:
# 3
# Launch School is the best!
# Launch School is the best!
# Launch School is the best!

# My answer

loop do
  puts "How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3: "
  answer = gets.chomp.to_i
  if answer >= 3
    answer.times { puts "Launch School is the best!"}
    break
  elsif answer < 3
  puts "That's not enough lines."
  end
end

# number_of_lines = nil
# loop do puts '>> How many output lines do you want? Enter a number >= 3:'
#   number_of_lines = gets.to_i
#   break if number_of_lines >= 3
#   puts ">> That's not enough lines."
# end

# while number_of_lines > 0
#   puts 'Launch School is the best!'
#   number_of_lines -= 1
# end
