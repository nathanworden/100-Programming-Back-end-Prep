# Print Something (Part 2)
# In the previous exercise, you wrote a program that asks the user if they want the program to print "something". However, this program recognized any input as valid: if you answered anything but y, it treated it as an n response, and quit without printing anything.

# Modify your program so it prints an error message for any inputs that aren't y or n, and then asks you to try again. Keep asking for a response until you receive a valid y or n response. In addition, your program should allow both Y and N (uppercase) responses; case sensitive input is generally a poor user interface choice. Whenever possible, accept both uppercase and lowercase inputs.

# Examples:

# $ ruby something2.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# y
# something

# $ ruby something2.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# help
# >> Invalid input! Please enter y or n
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# Y
# something

# $ ruby something2.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# N

# $ ruby something2.rb
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# NO
# >> Invalid input! Please enter y or n
# >> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)
# n

input = ""

until input == "y" || input == "n"
  puts ">> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)"
  input = gets.chomp.downcase
  if input == "y"
    puts "something"
  elsif input == "n"
    puts "Fine. I won't"
  end
  puts "That wasn't a valid response. Please enter either 'y' or 'n'."
end




# Book Answer:


# Solution
# choice = nil
# loop do
#   puts '>> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)'
#   choice = gets.chomp.downcase
#   break if %w(y n).include?(choice)
#   puts '>> Invalid input! Please enter y or n'
# end
# puts 'something' if choice == 'y'
# Discussion
# The solution to this exercise will become a familiar pattern early during your Launch School learning. We use a plain loop to solicit inputs until we have a valid input, then exit that loop.

# In most such loops, we will need the user's choice after the loop finishes running. Since variables created inside of loops are scoped in such a way that they aren't visible outside the loop, we must start by first defining the variable we want to use. Here we start by setting choice to nil; this guarantees that choice will be available both inside the loop and after the loop has finished running.

# Inside the loop, we display our prompt, and then use #gets to read the user's input. We also use #chomp in this case to get rid of the newline, and #downcase to convert the input to lowercase.

# Next, we use break to exit the loop if the user's input is a valid choice. Here we use #include? and apply it against an Array that contains the list of valid entries (y and n). We use the %w() shortcut syntax to represent the Array since it is easier to read %w(y n) than ['y', 'n'].

# If we have an invalid response, we display an error message, after which the loop repeats. It continues repeating until a valid choice is entered.

# After the loop finishes, we perform the requested action: we print '"something"', but only if the user's choice was y.
