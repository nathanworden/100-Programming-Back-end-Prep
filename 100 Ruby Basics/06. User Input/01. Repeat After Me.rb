# Repeat after me
# Write a program that asks the user to type something in, after which your program should simply display what was entered.

# Example:

# $ ruby repeater.rb
# >> Type anything you want:
# This is what I typed.
# This is what I typed.


# My Answer:
puts "Type anything you want:"
response = gets.chomp
puts response




# Solution

# puts ">> Type anything you want:"
# text = gets
# puts text


# Discussion
# This program first uses #puts to display a prompt. The use of >> is nothing special - we just use it to distinguish prompts from other kinds of text displayed by the program. It doesn't matter if you leave it off.

# After displaying the prompt, we use #gets to read a line of input from the user and store it a variable named text.

# Finally, we use #puts a second time to redisplay what the user typed.
