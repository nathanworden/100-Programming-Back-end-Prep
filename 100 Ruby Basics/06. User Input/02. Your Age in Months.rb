# Your Age in Months
# Write a program that asks the user for their age in years, and then converts that age to months.

# Examples:

# $ ruby age.rb
# >> What is your age in years?
# 35
# You are 420 months old.


puts ">> What is your age in years?"
age = gets.chomp.to_i

puts "You are #{age * 12} months old"


# Solution

# puts '>> What is your age in years?'
# age_in_years = gets
# age_in_months = 12 * age_in_years.to_i
# puts "You are #{age_in_months} months old."


# Discussion
# This solution is very similar to that of the previous exercise: we use #puts to display a prompt and output our results. and use #gets to obtain a value from the user.

# In addition, we need to perform a calculation on the input value. To accomplish this, we need to convert the input value (which is a String) to an Integer, which we do with the #to_i method. We then multiply the result by 12 to get the age in months.

# Further Exploration
# What happens if you enter a non-numeric value for the age?
