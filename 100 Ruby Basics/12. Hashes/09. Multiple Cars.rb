#  Multiple Cars
# Create a nested hash using the following data.

# Car

# type  color year
# sedan blue  2003
# Truck

# type  color year
# pickup

# My Answer:
# Wrong

car = {
      type: sedan,
      color: blue,
      year: 2003
      truck: {
              type: pickup,
              color: red,
              year: 1998
               }
    }


# Book Answer:

{ car:    {type: 'sedan', color: 'blue', year: 2003},
  truck:  {type: 'pickup', color: 'red', year: 1998} 
}


# Solution
# {
#   car:   { type: 'sedan', color: 'blue', year: 2003 },
#   truck: { type: 'pickup', color: 'red', year: 1998 }
# }
# Discussion
# Just as you can nest arrays, you can also nest hashes. Once you understand clearly how key-value pairs work, you'll realize that keys and values can be any form of object. In our solution, the value of :truck is:

# { type: 'pickup', color: 'red', year: 1998 }
# The value is the entire hash even though the nested hash contains its own key-value pairs.
