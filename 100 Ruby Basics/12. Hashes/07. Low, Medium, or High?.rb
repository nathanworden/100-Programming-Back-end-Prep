# Low, Medium, or High?
# Use Hash#select to iterate over numbers and return a hash containing only key-value pairs where the value is less than 25. Assign the returned hash to a variable named low_numbers and print its value using #p.

# numbers = {
#   high:   100,
#   medium: 50,
#   low:    10
# }
# Expected output:

# {:low:=>10}


numbers = {
  high:   100,
  medium: 50,
  low:    10
}


low_numbers = numbers.select do |key, value|
                value < 25
              end

p low_numbers



# Solution
# low_numbers = numbers.select do |key, value|
#                  value < 25
#                end

# p low_numbers
# Discussion
# Unlike Enumerable#map, Hash#select returns a hash instead of an array. Specifically, #select returns a new hash consisting of entries for which the block returns true.

# As in the previous exercise, we can assign the returned hash to a variable for later use.
