# Combining Names
# Using the following code, combine the two names together to form a full name and assign that value to a variable named full_name. Then, print the value of full_name.

 first_name = 'John'
 last_name = 'Doe'

# Expected output:

# John Doe


full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

puts full_name




# Solution
# first_name = 'John'
# last_name = 'Doe'

# full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
# puts full_name
# Discussion
# Adding strings together can be accomplished in multiple ways. In the solution, we use String#+ to add the specified strings together and return a new string: "John Doe". By using String#+, we must assign the returned string to a variable if we want to use it at a later time. Otherwise, the returned string will be inaccessible.

# If we didn't want to create a new variable, and instead modify the existing strings, we could have used String#<<, like this:

# first_name = 'John'
# last_name = 'Doe'

# first_name << last_name
# puts first_name # => JohnDoe
# String#<< mutates the caller, which means first_name now represents the full name. This isn't the desired result for this exercise, which is why String#+ was used instead of String#<<.

# Further Exploration
# Can you think of at least two additional ways to combine 
# a first and last name into a full name?

# String Interpolation
