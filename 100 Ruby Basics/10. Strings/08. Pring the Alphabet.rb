# Discussion
# It's common to split strings by character or words. 
# In fact, Ruby provides a method named String#split that 
# conveniently does this for us. By invoking #split on 
# alphabet and passing an empty string as an argument, 
# we can separate individual characters in alphabet. To print
# each character, we simply need to use #puts because #split 
# returns an array containing each character as its own element.
