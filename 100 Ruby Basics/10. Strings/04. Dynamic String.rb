# Dynamic String
# Modify the following code so that the value of name is printed within "Hello, !".

# name = 'Elizabeth'

# puts "Hello, !"
# Expected output:

# Hello, Elizabeth!

name = 'Elizabeth'

puts "Hello, #{name}!"

# Discussion
# One of the advantages of using double-quotes is the ability to use string interpolation. With string interpolation, you can invoke a variable - or a method - within a string, and Ruby will automatically call #to_s on the value. This allows us to include dynamic values within a string.

# In the solution, we include the name variable in the string by surrounding the invocation of it with curly braces ({}) and prepending those curly braces with the pound sign (#). This tells Ruby to evaluate the code within the curly braces.
