# Doubled
# In the code below, an array containing the numbers 1 through 5 is assigned to numbers.

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Use Array#map to iterate over numbers and return a new array with each number doubled. Assign the returned array to a variable named doubled_numbers and print its value using #p.

# Expected output:

# [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

doubled_numbers = numbers.map do |num|
                  num * 2
                  end

p doubled_numbers


# OR, another way to do it:

# doubled_numbers = []
# numbers.map do |num|
#   doubled_numbers.push(num * 2)
# end

# p doubled_numbers



# Book answer:
# Solution
# doubled_numbers = numbers.map do |number|
#                     number * 2
#                   end

# p doubled_numbers
# Discussion
# Using iterators is key to properly controlling data structures like arrays. In the previous exercise, we used Array#each to iterate over an array and print each element. In this exercise, we use Array#map which iterates over an array and returns a new array with each element transformed based on the block's return value. This means we can assign the return value of #map to a variable to use at a later time.

# The important thing to note here is how #map decides what value to place in the new array. Looking at the solution, we can see that the only statement within the block is number * 2. Therefore, the return value of this statement will be the block's return value. As stated earlier, we know that #map uses the return value of the block as the new element's value. This means that each element in the new array is the return value of the block at each iteration.
