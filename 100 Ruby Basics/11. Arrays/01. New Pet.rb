# New Pet
# In the code below, an array containing different types of pets is assigned to pets.

# pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']
# Select 'fish' from pets, assign the return value to a variable named my_pet, then print the value of my_pet.

# Expected output:

# I have a pet fish!

 pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

 my_pet = pets[2]

 puts "I have a pet #{my_pet}!"


#  Discussion
# When deciding how to select a specific element from an array, it's important to first know how arrays work. Every array has its own index where each element is numbered. Counting the indexes is just like counting normally, except instead of starting at 1, you start counting at 0. Consider the following example:

# ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']
#  0      1      2       3
# To select a specific element, like 'fish', all we need to know is the index number that corresponds with the element. Therefore, we can simply write pets[2] to return 'fish'. All that's left to do now is save it to a variable named my_pets and print "I have a pet #{my_pet}!".
