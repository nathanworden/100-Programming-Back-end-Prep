# Free the Lizard
# In the code below, an array containing different types of pets is assigned to pets. Also, the return value of pets[2..3], which is ['fish', 'lizard'], is assigned to my_pets.

# pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']
# my_pets = pets[2..3]
# Remove 'lizard' from my_pets then print the value of my_pets.

# Expected output:

# I have a pet fish!

 pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']
 my_pets = pets[2..3]

my_pets.pop

puts "I have a pet #{my_pets[0]}!"




# Approach/Algorithm
# Array#pop is used to remove and return the last element of an array.

# Solution
# my_pets.pop

# puts "I have a pet #{my_pets[0]}!"
# Discussion
# Knowing how to modify a data structure, like an array, is crucial to using them in your programs. In our solution, we use #pop to remove the last element from my_pets. We're able to use this method because 'lizard' is the last element. If it wasn't, we'd have to remove it some other way.

# The key thing to note here when printing my_pets is that my_pets is still an array. It looks like this: ['fish']. Just because it only has one element doesn't mean it somehow converted to a string. Arrays can contain any number of elements, even none.
