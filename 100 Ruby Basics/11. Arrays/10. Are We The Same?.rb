# Are We The Same?
# In the code below, two arrays containing several numbers are assigned to two variables, array1 and array2.

# array1 = [1, 5, 9]
# array2 = [1, 9, 5]
# Compare array1 and array2 and print true or false based on whether they match.


array1 = [1, 5, 9]
array2 = [1, 9, 5]

puts array1 == array2



# Discussion
# There's more than one way to compare arrays but perhaps the simplest way is using ==. In the solution, we use == to compare the value of array1 to the value of array2 and print the return value, which is false, with #puts.

# Note that == treats two Arrays as equal if they contain the same number of elements, and each element in one Array is equal to the corresponding element in the second Array.
